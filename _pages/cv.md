**Graduate Student Researcher & Teaching Assistant**  
* University of California, San Diego*  
  Summer 2023 - Present  
  <!-- Roles include teaching assistant for CSE 291: Security, Privacy, UX and CSE 194: Race, Gender, and Computing. As well as conducting grad-level research for the UJIMA Security & Research Group under the guidance of Dr. Munyaka. -->

  ### As a Teaching Assistant, my responsibilities included:

- ***Conducting weekly discussion sections*** where students could deepen their understanding of course material through additional examples and exercises.
- ***Assisting in the design and grading of homework assignments and exams*** to ensure fair and rigorous assessment of student learning.
- ***Holding regular office hours*** to provide individualized support and clarification on complex topics to students.
- ***Facilitating exam logistics*** such as proctoring exams to ensure academic integrity during examinations.
- ***Grading coursework*** Reviewing assignments submitted by student and grading their work.

* CSE 127. Introduction to Computer Security - Teaching Assistant (Winter 2025)
opics include basic cryptography, security/threat analysis, access control, auditing, security models, distributed systems security, and theory behind common attack and defense techniques. The class will go over formal models as well as the bits and bytes of security exploits.

* CSE 291: Security, Privacy, UX - Teaching Assistant (Winter 2024)
The effectiveness of security tools, systems, or processes is often determined by how users understand, implement, and respond to them. Therefore, it is crucial that researchers and developers of security and privacy solutions understand how to create tools with users in mind. In this course, we will explore the human factors of security and privacy solutions, and learn how to apply user-centered design principles to develop and evaluate those solutions. Students will be introduced to various security topics and the concepts necessary to conduct user studies. Course topics include accessibility, authentication, privacy policies, security warnings, developer tools, security education, and training. All students will work on a research project throughout the course with the goal of producing a paper suitable for publication.

* CSE 194. Race, Gender, and Computing - Teaching Assistant (Fall 2023)
This course explores the challenges of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in computing and technology through an introduction to and analysis of various social constructs and their impact on not only computing-related organizations, but also the technologies developed and the people affected by them. This course also introduces students to cultural competence in the context of computing.

Coursework
======

### Fall 2022
* **CSE 210: Principles of Software Engineering**
    * General principles in modern software engineering. Both theoretical and practical topics are covered. Theoretical topics include proofs of correctness, programming language semantics, and theory of testing. Practical topics include structured programming, modularization techniques, design of languages for reliable programming, and software tools.
* **CSE 291: Usability of Programming Languages**
    * Apply qualitative and quantitative research methods to obtain insights about programming language design choices. Critically analyze design questions in the context of languages and programming systems. Read and interpret research papers in the area of usability of programming languages, and summarize major findings to date.

* **CSE 202: Algorithm Design and Analysis**
    * Learning techniques for the design and analysis of algorithms. Divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, data structures, graph search, algebraic problems randomized algorithms, lower bounds, probabilistic analysis, parallel algorithms. 
* **CSE 291: Antisocial Computing**
    * Explored many of the problems of social media: disinformation, bias, extremism, surveillance, among others. Students will learn 1) how design choices (in interfaces and algorithms) can impact the function and style of online communities, 2) how aspects of human psychology drive the problems that arise, and 3) understand how these same topics have been explored in art, fiction, and film. Using these theoretical understandings, students will explore how to design better social computing systems.
