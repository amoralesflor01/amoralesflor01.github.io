This section outlines my experience as a teaching assistant for the graduate course **CSE 291: Security, Privacy, UX** under Professor Imani Munyaka during the Winter 2024 quarter.

CSE 291: Security, Privacy, UX
======

The effectiveness of security tools, systems, or processes is often determined by how users understand, implement, and respond to them. Therefore, it is crucial that researchers and developers of security and privacy solutions understand how to create tools with users in mind. In this course, we will explore the human factors of security and privacy solutions, and learn how to apply user-centered design principles to develop and evaluate those solutions. Students will be introduced to various security topics and the concepts necessary to conduct user studies. Course topics include accessibility, authentication, privacy policies, security warnings, developer tools, security education, and training. All students will work on a research project throughout the course with the goal of producing a paper suitable for publication.
